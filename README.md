# DoomCaster
The perfect toolkit for lazy hacking.

# What the f#ck is this shit?

This project started as a simple rewrite of a Perl Script I used to find
the administrative page of sites vulnerable to SQL Injection, but a I saw
an chance to create my own toolkit for some tasks related hacking and this
is the result.

# How do I install your shitty and bad written ruby code?

You will need:

-- git

-- rake

-- ruby

In your terminal, execute these commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/53F4N/doomcaster
$ rake
```

Inside the folder these commands were ran, there'll be a file named
"doomcaster-VERSION.zip", extract this file and execute the install.sh
script inside it. Or change to the production/ directory inside the
project and execute the install script.

You can freely distribute the zip.
