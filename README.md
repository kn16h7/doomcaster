# DoomCaster
The perfect toolkit for lazy hacking.

# What the f#ck is this shit?

This project started as a simple rewrite of a Perl Script I used to find
the administrative page of sites vulnerable to SQL Injection, but a I saw
an chance to create my own toolkit for some tasks related hacking and this
is the result.

# How do I install your shitty and bad written ruby code?

You will need:

-- git

-- rake

-- ruby

In your terminal, execute these commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/53F4N/doomcaster
$ cd doomcaster
$ rake all clean
```

If you want the zip Rake creates, execute a ```rake all``` instead, and a file
named doomcaster-VERSION.zip will be in the project root directory. This zip
contains the entire project packaged and with the build capaable to be reproduced.

# Why is this readme file so silly and devoid of seriousness?

Because I do not take this project so seriously.
